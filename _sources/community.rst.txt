Keeping up-to-date
------------------

On `the GitHub repository <https://github.com/acmelab-ua/FEPX>`_, FEPX's official releases are available under the `release tab <https://github.com/acmelab-ua/FEPX/releases>`_.  All official releases are tagged and available from the `main branch <https://github.com/acmelab-ua/FEPX/tree/main>`_.
FEPX is under continuous development, and we release new versions frequently.

Make sure to `watch <https://help.github.com/en/articles/watching-and-unwatching-repositories#watching-a-single-repository>`_ `the GitHub repository <https://github.com/acmelab-ua/FEPX>`_ to be notified of new releases (or conversations, etc.).  If you do not have a GitHub account, you will need to create one, which is a matter of minutes.
