## Keeping up-to-date

On [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/acmelab-ua/FEPX), FEPX's official releases are available under the [release tab](https://github.com/acmelab-ua/FEPX/releases). The latest version of the code is available from the [main branch](https://github.com/acmelab-ua/FEPX/tree/main). FEPX is under continuous development, and we push new commits frequently.

Make sure to [watch](https://help.github.com/en/articles/watching-and-unwatching-repositories#watching-a-single-repository>) [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/acmelab-ua/FEPX) to be notified of new releases (or conversations, etc.). If you do not have a GitHub account, you will need to create one, which is a matter of minutes.
