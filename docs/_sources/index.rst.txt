FEPX is a finite element software package for polycrystal plasticity. It can model both the global and local mechanical behaviors of large polycrystalline aggregates with complex microstructures via a scalable parallel framework.

.. note::

    See also FEPX's companion program, `Neper <https://neper.info>`_, a polycrystal generation and meshing tool. Neper acts as the primary pre- and post-processor for FEPX.

FEPX is currently developed by the Advanced Computational Materials Engineering Laboratory `ACME Lab <https://acmelab.ua.edu>`_ at The University of Alabama, USA, and CNRS, France.
