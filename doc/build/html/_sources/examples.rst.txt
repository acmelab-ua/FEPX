Example Simulations
===================

Several example simulations come pre-packaged to get you started with running
simulations. These examples are reference cases to show how a simulation should
be built and how FEPX can interface with Neper in order to prepare mesh files
as well as post-process a simulation directory. All examples contain the
necessary configuration (@file{simulation.config}) and mesh
(@file{simulation.msh})  files, along with a shell script to generate the mesh
file directly from Neper. In order to run the provided shell scripts, you must
have a configured installation of Neper present on your system. In the
following, visualizations of the undeformed and deformed mesh are generated
with Neper while graphs are generated with Gnuplot.

All examples can be run either in serial or parallel
(@pxref{Running a Simulation}), but the included scripts are pre-set to run in
parallel on 4 cores, and parallel execution with OpenMPI via @code{mpirun} is
assumed.

A polycrystal containing 50 grains is generated via Voronoi tessellation for
all examples. Each cell in the tessellation represents a discrete grain in the
domain and all grains are volumetrically discretized into finite elements.
Visualizations of the tessellated domain (morphology) and the associated finite
element mesh are in @ref{mesh}. Length units are assumed to be [mm], thus, all
pressure units assumed to be [MPa] for the simulation (including input
parameters).

@node Example Uniaxial
@section Uniaxial Control (@file{examples/1_uniaxial})

This example covers the uniaxial tensile deformation of an FCC polycrystal by
strain targeting to 2% axial strain.  Material parameters are of a generic a
copper alloy, and are provided in @ref{uniaxial-elasticity} and
@ref{uniaxial-plasticity}. Two steps are defined with a variable number of
increments for each step. Grip boundary conditions are applied to the sample
with the primary loading face set as @samp{z1} loaded in the @var{+Z} direction.
Elemental stress and elastic strain tensors are output, along with the nodal
coordinates and surface-integrated forces. Illustrations of the stress and
elastic strain fields are provided in @ref{uniaxial}. Material parameters are
defined as:

@node Example TriaxCSR
@section Multiaxial Control with Constant Strain Rate (@file{examples/2_triaxCSR})

This example covers the biaxial deformation of an HCP polycrystal at a constant
strain rate. Loads are applied normal to the surface, maintaining proportional
macroscopic load ratios of @math{-1}:@math{0}:1 for the
@math{X}:@math{Y}:@math{Z} directions, respectively. Load tolerance options
are prescribed and latent hardening is enabled, as well as saturation strength
evolution. The primary loading direction is set to be in the @var{X} direction,
and the strain rate is doubled on the
second step. Elemental values for the equivalent plastic strain and
plastic work are output, along with the nodal coordinates and
surface-integrated forces. Material parameters are those for the
@math{\alpha}-phase of Ti-6Al-4V and are provided in
@ref{multiaxial-strain-elasticity}, @ref{multiaxial-strain-plasticity-initial}
and @ref{multiaxial-strain-plasticity-relative}. The latent parameters are

@section Multiaxial Control with Constant Load Rate (@file{examples/3_triaxCLR})

This example covers the triaxial deformation of a dual phase FCC/BCC
polycrystal (phase map shown on @ref{multiaxial-load}(left)) at a constant
load rate followed by a dwell episode and subsequent unloading. Loads are
applied normal to the surface, maintaining proportional macroscopic load
ratios of @math{-0.375}:@math{-0.625}:1 for the @math{X}:@math{Y}:@math{Z}
directions, respectively. Load tolerance options are prescribed. The primary
loading direction is set to be in the @var{Z} direction, and a dwell episode
is initiated on the second step. Elemental critical resolved shear stresses and
equivalent strains are output, along with the nodal coordinates and
surface-integrated forces. Material parameters are those for the austenitic
(@math{\gamma}) and ferritic (@math{\alpha}) phases of an LDX-2101 steel, and
are provided in @ref{multiaxial-load-elasticity},
@ref{multiaxial-load-plasticity} and @ref{multiaxial-load-cyclic}.

@node Example Restart
@section Restarting a Simulation with Appended Load Steps (@file{examples/4_restart})

An example use case for the restart capabilities are to append additional
loading steps to a completed simulation. This example covers the cyclic triaxial
deformation of an FCC polycrystal at a constant strain rate. Each restart simulation adds
an addition load-unload cycle. Loads are applied normal to the surface, maintaining
proportional macroscopic load ratios of @math{0}:@math{0}:1 for the
@math{X}:@math{Y}:@math{Z} directions, respectively. Load tolerance options
are prescribed and cyclic hardening is activated. The primary loading direction
is set to be in the @var{Z} direction. Elemental equivalent plastic
deformation rate, slip system shears, slip system shear rates, nodal
coordinates, and restart files are output. Restart files are only printed on
the first cycle. Material parameters are those for a AL6XN steel and are
provided in @ref{restart-elasticity} and @ref{restart-plasticity}.
Illustrations of the results are provided in @ref{restart}.

The included shell script will run the initial simulation in
@file{examples/4_restart/cycle1} which runs 2 load steps (a single load-unload cycle)
and prints the files necessary to restart the simulation from the final state (using print
option @option{print restart}). After successful completion of the first cycle, the mesh
file and restart files are copied into the secondary directory
(@file{examples/4_restart/cycle2}) and the simulation is performed again for
another 2 load steps (a second load-unload cycle). The configuration file for the
second cycle (@file{simulation_cycle2.config}) contains the following input to allow for
simulating additional load steps to those already completed:

@inputfilehead
@example
@option{restart on}
@end example
@inputfilefoot

along with the additional load steps in the @samp{Deformation History} section.
The restarted simulation will continue with the load steps as defined in
@file{simulation_cycle2.config}. Restart control information will print to the
console upon the execution of the second cycle to briefly assess the state of
the sample when the simulation is restarted. Material parameters are defined as:

@node Example External
@section Running a Simulation with External Definition Files (@file{examples/5_external})

Certain simulation input may be supplied from external files in order to allow
for a static configuration and mesh file to be used for multiple simulations
while certain microstructure information is varied. This example covers the
uniaxial loading and unloading (via load targeting) of a dual phase FCC/BCC
polycrystal including in-grain orientation distributions. Two steps are
defined with a standard time-step value of @w{0.1 s} and a minimum time-step
value of @w{0.01 s}. Minimal boundary conditions are applied to the sample
with the primary loading face set as @samp{x1} loaded in the @var{+X}
direction. Elemental orientations and grain/phase assignments are supplied
from the external files @file{simulation.ori} and @file{simulation.phase},
respectively. Elemental equivalent deformation rate, work, orientations,
surface-integrated forces, and nodal coordinates are output. Fiber-averaging
processing is enabled and data for three fibers for the first phase is
generated per-step. Material parameters are those for the austenitic
(@math{\gamma}) and ferritic (@math{\alpha}) phases of a LDX-2101 steel and
were previously provided in @ref{multiaxial-load-elasticity} and
@ref{multiaxial-load-plasticity}.
Illustrations of the results are provided in @ref{external-res} and
@ref{external-res2}.

Phases are assigned to grains in @file{simulation.phase} based on grain ID,
resulting in a 50%/50% phase distribution, by:

@inputfilehead
@example
@option{$Groups}
@option{elset}
@option{50}
@option{1} @var{1}
@option{2} @var{1}
...
@option{26} @var{2}
...
@option{50} @var{2}
@option{$EndGroups}
@end example
@inputfilefoot

Orientations are assigned to individual elements in the mesh by:

@inputfilehead
@example
@option{$ElementOrientations}
@option{5455} @var{rodrigues:active}
@option{1} @var{-0.251740631650} @var{-0.214936324918} @var{0.002481866070}
@option{2} @var{-0.263893837934} @var{-0.212836283407} @var{0.021747296015}
...
@option{5454} @var{-0.062896691423} @var{0.070800028157} @var{0.312930553247}
@option{5455} @var{-0.055849086418} @var{0.072826013322} @var{0.294773397825}
@option{$EndElementOrientations}
@end example
@inputfilefoot

Note that even though @samp{$ElsetOrientations} are also present in
@file{simulation.ori} as generated via Neper, the presence of
@samp{$ElementOrientations} will always override any other orientations
present in @file{simulation.ori} or in the mesh file (@file{simulation.msh}).

The definitions of the crystallographic fibers for the fiber averaging routine
are defined in @file{simulation.fib} by:

@inputfilehead
@example
@option{1 1 1 -1.000000  0.000000  0.000000 1 5}
@option{1 1 1 -0.993884 -0.110432  0.000000 1 5}
...
@option{2 2 0  0.993884  0.110432  0.000000 1 5}
@option{2 2 0  1.000000  0.000000  0.000000 1 5}
@end example
@inputfilefoot

Three unique fibers (@samp{hkl} triplets) are defined in the file. The
associated sample directions (@samp{uvw} triplets) define unique points on a
coarse mesh of a pole figure. The selection of sample directions in this
manner allows for the fiber averaged output data to be visualized as a
pole figure as seen in @ref{external-res3}.
