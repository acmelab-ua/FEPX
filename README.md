# FEPX - Finite Element Polycrystal Plasticity

## Overview

FEPX is a parallel finite element-based elasto-viscoplastic framework for use in modeling large deformations of polycrystalline aggregates. Its primary features are:

* Nonlinear kinematics capable of resolving large strains and large rotations
* Anisotropic elasticity based on crystal symmetry
* Anisotropic plasticity based on rate-dependent slip restricted to dominant slip systems
* State variable evolution for crystal lattice orientation and slip system strengths

## Installation

Installation instructions for FEPX are provided in the documentation included in the distribution or available [here](https://fepx.info/doc/index.html).
